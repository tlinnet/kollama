  This KNIME extension provides nodes for connecting to and prompting large language models (LLMs),

  chat and embeddings models provided by OpenAI, Hugging Face Hub and GPT4ALL.

  There are also nodes for building and querying the vector stores Chroma and FAISS, as well as nodes for combining

  multiple vector stores and LLMs into agents that can dynamically decide which vector store to query for information given the
  user prompt.
